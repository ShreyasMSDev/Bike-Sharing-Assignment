# BoomBikes Bike Sharing Assignment


## **Problem Statement**

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider **BoomBikes** has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors. 

### Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information

The Bike Sharing Assignment is an exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling project aimed at understanding the factors influencing bike demand.

### Objectives:  
1. **Understand Patterns in Bike Usage**:  
   - Explore and analyze the dataset to uncover trends and relationships between various features and bike demand.  

2. **Predict Bike Demand**:  
   - Use statistical and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for bike-sharing demand based on historical data.  

3. **Identify Key Features**:  
   - Determine the most influential factors affecting bike-sharing demand, such as weather conditions, time of year, or holidays.  

### Dataset:  
The dataset used in this project contains information about bike rentals, including features such as:  
- **Time-based Attributes**: Year, month, weekday, etc.  
- **Weather Information**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.  
- **Demand Data**: Count of bike rentals (dependent variable).  

### Deliverables:  
- An end-to-end data analysis workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.  
- Insights and visualizations to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions.  
- A well-documented Python script and this README file for easy understanding of the project.


## Conclusions

### Model Summary, Performance Evaluation, and Conclusion
**Equation of the Best Fit Line:**

The equation representing the best-fit line for predicting bike demand (cnt) is:

**cnt** = 3477.19 + 2027.95 x **yr** + 481.86 x **workingday** + 923.13 x **temp** − 970.07 x **spring** + 491.99 x **winter** − 571.82 x **July** + 541.30 x **September** + 555.89 x **Saturday** − 703.49 x **Cloudy** − 2645.69 x **Rainy**

**Performance Evaluation:**

- **Training Set:** R² score = 0.83
- **Testing Set:** R² score = 0.81
- **RMSE (Training Set):** 811.93
- **RMSE (Test Set):** 819.67 

**Conclusion:**

- The model demonstrates a high degree of accuracy, with **R² scores** of **0.83** for the training set and **0.81** for the testing set. This indicates that the model is able to explain a significant proportion of the variance in both the training and test datasets, showing effective generalization.

- The RMSE values of approximately 811.93 for the training set and 819.67 for the test set further suggest that the model is fitting well to the training data and generalizing reasonably to new, unseen data. The small difference between the training and testing RMSE values indicates that the model is not overfitting and performs consistently on new data.

- Key features, such as **'year (yr)'**, **'workingday'**, **'temperature (temp)'**, and seasonal factors like **'winter'** and **'spring'**, are important drivers of bike demand. The relatively high coefficient values for **'temp'** and **'yr'** indicate their significant impact on demand predictions.

- Overall, the model exhibits a strong fit, with minimal variance in performance between training and testing, suggesting that it is well-equipped to predict bike demand with reliable accuracy.
